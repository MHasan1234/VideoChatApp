# Confera - Real-Time Video Chat Application

Confera is a modern, full-stack video chat application designed for seamless real-time communication. It allows users to create accounts, join video meetings, and interact through video, audio, and text chat. The project is built with a robust MERN-stack architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and utilizes WebRTC for high-quality, peer-to-peer video streaming.

## ‚ú® Features Breakdown

### Frontend (Client-Side)

-   **Authentication Pages**: Clean, intuitive forms for user registration and login.
-   **Protected Routes**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access core application pages like the home and history screens.
-   **Home Dashboard**: A central hub for authenticated users to start or join meetings by entering a meeting code.
-   **Interactive Video Room**:
    -   **Media Controls**: Simple toggles to mute/unmute the microphone and turn the camera on/off.
    -   **Screen Sharing**: Functionality to share your screen with other participants for presentations or collaboration.
    -   **Real-Time Chat**: An integrated chat panel for sending and receiving text messages during a call.
-   **Meeting History**: A dedicated page that lists all past meetings a user has joined, with the ability to rejoin any meeting with a single click.

### Backend (Server-Side)

-   **Secure User API**: RESTful endpoints for handling user registration and login.
-   **Password Hashing**: Utilizes **bcrypt** to securely hash and salt user passwords, ensuring they are never stored in plain text.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Tokens to secure the API. A token is generated on login and used to authenticate subsequent requests.
-   **Meeting History API**: Endpoints to save a new meeting to a user's record and to fetch the complete history for a logged-in user.
-   **Real-Time Signaling Server (Socket.IO)**:
    -   **WebRTC Signaling**: Manages the exchange of connection metadata (offers, answers, ICE candidates) required to establish direct peer-to-peer video streams.
    -   **Room Management**: Handles users joining and leaving specific meeting rooms and notifies other participants of these events.
    -   **Chat Broadcasting**: Relays live chat messages to all participants within the same meeting room.
-   **Database Modeling**: Uses **Mongoose** to define schemas and models for `Users` and `Meetings` for structured data storage in MongoDB.
-   **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured to allow requests from the deployed frontend application, ensuring smooth communication between the two services.
